# What drives the price of a car?
In this project, we analyze a dataset from Kaggle containing information on 426k used cars, reduced from the original 3 million for faster processing. Our objective is to identify the key factors that influence a car's price. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations to a used car dealership to better understand what consumers value in a used vehicle.
